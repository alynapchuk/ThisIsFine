# Week 1 at Digital Crafts Bootcamp

I started this week with the bare minimum in terms of knowledge behind coding and software development, so I was a bit nervous to say the least. I was able to work on a good bit of the preassignments, and not to get too much into my personal life, but my mother was admitted to the hospital the week prior to starting class and the Sunday before I recieved a concerning call from the hospital. Although this was going on I was able to find a sort of escape and solice in my studying. Something about just clicky-clackin' away on the computer just really gets ya' going, you know?

After meeting my instructor, the TAs, and my fellow students I felt a lot more confident in what the next few weeks would bring.

It was pretty easy to grasp the base concepts we were learning such as the command line and the very basics of Python. I enjoyed making lists, and dictionaries were very easy, but I think the one thing that confuses me a bit still would have to be if and when loops and how exactly to set them up properly to execute what you want to happen.

On Friday, the last day of week one, I was able to join in on another cohort and watch them present their first back-end projects. It was a great glimpse into the future of our own cohort in the coming weeks and was thrilling to see what these groups are already accomplishing.
