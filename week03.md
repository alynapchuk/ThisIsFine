This week was probably the most fun so far. On Monday we were all able to show off our Python projects and some of the things my class came up with were too cool for school ya’ll. I found that going onto GitHub and browsing through their codes also gave me some great new ideas and better insight.

We were introduced to working with HTML and CSS this week as well, and I felt like I was able to understand the concepts pretty quickly and easily. It was very exciting to start building web pages from scratch, even though they’re pretty simple.

It did get a little difficult once we dived deeper into flexbox and but the more we practiced the more it made sense, and eventually I was able make my pages look just how I wanted, which was super fun and cool and exciting!
