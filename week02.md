# Week 2 at Digital Crafts Bootcamp

This has been a very exciting week! It’s starting to feel like everything that I have been taught thus far is finally settling in and through trial and error I’ve been able to better understand how to write working code with Python. As I mentioned last week, I am a complete newbie to all these concepts and it did take a lot for me to connect all the dots, but once I saw the patterns it all started to make sense.

This was our first time being assigned an actual project, as well as our first time working in actual groups. I’m always nervous working with new people but our group very quickly jumped over any walls and we were shooting ideas and laughs back and forth in no time. It was great getting to know everyone. We were all also very encouraging of each other which I am most thankful for. 

For our project, we had decided to expand on my code from our RPG exercise. In the beginning, I spent a lot of time pulling from other references and going back to look at older exercises we completed previously. It definitely felt like I was dragging along, but as the presentation time approached and I began really digging in and most importantly asking for help, I was understanding the concepts and recognizing the patterns in no time. After that, everything felt like butter. 

I do wish that I would have been able to add more features and be a little more creative with our final project, but I’m very happy with the end result and just the fact that we had something that WORKED! 

I think the thing that most assisted with me really solidifying these concepts was being able to walk through and explain everything back to my group when we were debugging and practicing our presentation. The imposter syndrome is definitely still there, and I still feel like I have no clue what I’m really doing, but it was validating and is making me more confident for what is to come! I’m really excited to continue building on top of what I know now.
